BisaChat Plus (BC+)

This userscript adds several new features to the chat located at <http://www.bisafans.de/>. 
The basis is a full screen GUI which fits the users browser window. Furthermore this script 
adds and module based add-on functionality. The most significant feature for new modules 
is the Message Prefilter. This allows you to do whatever you want with any message just before 
it's shown to the user. So far, thar a things like BBCode and smilie hiding.
Another important module is the last.fm module. With your last.fm username entered, that module 
shows what you're listening to via one click. Provided that scrobbling is turned on.

Installation Information

Right now, BC+ only supports Firefox 4. Firefox 3 support was dropped in the beta phase because 
Firefox 3 just can't handle some features. Right now, the script work both in Greasemonkey and in 
Scriptish. Personally I recommed the use of Scriptish.
