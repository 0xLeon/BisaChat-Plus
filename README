BisaChat Plus (BC+)

This userscript adds several new features to the chat located at <http://www.bisaboard.de/>. 
The basis is a full screen GUI which fits the users browser window. Furthermore this script 
adds a module based add-on functionality. The most significant feature for new modules 
is the Message Prefilter. This allows you to do whatever you want with any message just before 
it's shown to the user. So far, there are things like BBCode and smilie hiding.
Another important module is the last.fm module. With your last.fm username entered, this module 
shows what you're listening to via one click, provided scrobbling is turned on.

Installation Information

Right now, BC+ supports Firefox 4 and higher only. The script works both in Greasemonkey and in 
Scriptish. Personally I recommed the use of Scriptish. Other userscript-able browsers (Opera and 
Chrome) will be supportet by BisChat Plus 2.0, which is about to be released at the of the year 
2011.
