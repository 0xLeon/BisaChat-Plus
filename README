BisaChat Plus (BCPlus)
------------
This userscript adds several new features to the chat located at <https://chat.bisaboard.de/>.

Installation Information
------------
BCPlus supports Firefox using Greasemonkey and Chrome with TamperMonkey. As for Firefox, Scriptish is not supported and so isn't Chrome's built-in userscript environment. You have to install the mandatory userscript addon for your browser prior to installing BCPlus.
